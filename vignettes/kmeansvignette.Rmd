# Introduction
The fast paced development of information technologies and the growth of their respective applications such as Internet search engines, digital imaging, and E-Commerce platforms has resulted in the creation of large databases with a 
variety of high-volume and multi-dimensional data sets (Crone et al., 2006). The volume of big data in worldwide data center storage is predicted to more than 
double from 179 exabytes at the current point of time to 403 exabytes in 2021 (Statista, 2019). Due to such data being stored digitally, for example in data warehouses or clouds, the analysis of said data is imperative to derive useful information and potential competitive advantages (Provost and Fawcett, 2013). 
While large amounts of data are gathered through different sources, such as web-trackers or transactions, the complexity of analyzing it is not to be underestimated due to most of this data being of unstructured nature 
(Jain, 2010). 

Therefore, statistical models and analysis techniques are necessary to gain 
useful insights and realize said potentials. Many of these techniques are types 
of machine learning algorithms, such as regression and clustering models and can 
be used to recognize patterns or derive other inferences from the data 
(Buck et al., 2008). While regression models are part of supervised learning, 
which are methods to predict the values of outputs with a known dataset that 
includes response values (i.e. training sample), cluster analysis is a method of unsupervised learning (Friedman et al., 2001). The goal of unsupervised learning 
techniques is to draw inferences from a dataset that does not include labeled responses. Cluster analysis is used for exploratory data analysis and aims to 
group a collection of objects into subsets, natural groups or so-called 
clusters, such that those within each cluster are more closely related to each 
other than to objects of different clusters (Jain, 2010; Friedman et al., 2001). 
An object is described either by a set of measurements or by relationships 
between the object and other objects (Jain and Dubes, 1988). Cluster analysis 
can be used in market research to partition consumers into market segments, 
which may help with the selection of competitive markets, and product 
development strategies. (Sarstedt and Mooi, 2014). Another application is the grouping of search results based on topological features offered by systems such
as Clusty and Lingo3G. These are used to cluster search results by using folder labels, for example  borough, city, or state and may create a more relevant set
of results for the end-users (Scaiella et al., 2012). 

A large number of clustering algorithms exist, such as Expectation-Maximization Clustering, DBSCAN, and k-means (Xu and Wunsch, 2005). While each clustering 
method offers its own advantages and disadvantages, this paper will solely focus
on the implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm in R. In the following chapter, the statistical and theoretical background of k-means will be 
introduced to demonstrate the functionality and methodology of the algorithm. Building on these foundations, the development and implementation of the 
R-package **kmeanss3** is going to be illustrated. Following this, the results 
of cluster analysis of the **IRIS** dataset using **kmeanss3** will be shown and compared with the results of *kmeans()* contained in the **stats** package of **CRAN**. Lastly, the implemented package will be discussed to underline both 
the contributions and limitations.

# Background

In this section the theortical as well as statistical background of the k-means algorithm that is implented in the package **kmeanss3** is presented. 

## Theoretical Background

The term "k-means algorithm" was first coined by MacQueen (1967) for a 
sequential version of the algorithm. Data points $x_i$ are processed in a
sequential order $s=1,2,...$ using the first *k* data points as "singleton
classes", also known as centroids or centers. Data points are then assigned to
the closest center from step *s*. In the following step, the centers are updated after each assignment (MacQueen, 1967). Despite MacQueen first coining the name, 
the algorithm has been proposed by several researchers in different forms and under different assumptions (Anderberg, 1973; Bock, 1974; Sp√§th, 1975). 

In the research fields of computer science and pattern recognition, k-means is
often referred to as Lloyd's algorithm (Bock, 2007). Lloyd (1982) considers the
sum of squares as clustering criterion in the context of pulse-code modulation. 
By minimizing the sum of squares, Lloyd is able to derive the optimality of 
centroids. He refers to his version of the k-means algorithm as "Method I", 
which despite only being publicly published in 1982, was first 
proposed in 1957 (Bock, 2007). In the implementation of **kmeanss3** Lloyd's algorithm plays a central role and is further detailed in Chapter 2.3.

## Statistical Background

K-means is the best-known squared error criterion-based clustering algorithm and 
is used for variables of quantitative type (Xu and Wunsch, 2005; Bock, 2007). 
Let *$X = (X_1,...,X_n)$* be a set of n-dimensional points to be clustered into
a set of K clusters *$C = (C_1,...,C_k)$*. The algorithm finds a partition such 
that the squared error between the mean of a cluster and the points in the 
cluster is minimized (Jain, 2010). For this, the squared Euclidean distance is 
used as the distance measure. It is denoted as (Friedman et al., 2001): 
\begin{align}
d(x_i,x_i') = \sum_{j=1}^p {(x_{ij} - x_{i'j})^2} = ||x_i - x_i'||^2\text{ .}
\end{align}
The within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) is given by:
\begin{align}
WSS(C_k) = \sum_{x_i \in {C_k}} {||x_i - \mu_k||^2}
\end{align}
where $\mu_k = (\mu_{1k},...,\mu_{pk})$ is the mean vector of the *k*th cluster
(Friedman et al, 2001). The WSS is to be minimized for each cluster $C_k$ by assigning the nearest *n* observations to it. The WSS for a cluster $C_k$ 
therefore represents the squared Euclidean distance from the center $\mu_k$ 
to each data point $x_i$ within the cluster. In other words, WSS measures how 
closely related the objects within a cluster are, also known as cluster 
cohesion. Summarizing the WSS of each cluster returns the total-WSS.

Another important metric is the between cluster sum of squares (BSS). This 
metric measures the cluster separation, i.e. how distinct or well-seperated the
created clusters are (Liu et al., 2010). The BSS is denoted as follows, with 
a weight $n_k$ that represents the number of elements in the *k*th cluster:
\begin{align}
BSS = \sum_{k=1}^K {n_k} {||\mu_k - \mu_i||^2}
\end{align}
Naturally, the BSS is maximized, when the WSS is minimized. This is due to the 
sum of the BSS and WSS being equal to the total sum of squares (TSS) (Liu et
al., 2010). The TSS depicts the squared distance between each data point and the overall mean. Due to this, the TSS is a constant for every data set: it does not change when the number of centers or the initial centers are changed. 
\begin{align}
TSS = \sum_{i=1}^N {||x_i - \mu_i||^2} = WSS + BSS
\end{align}

The goodness of fit is measured by the ratio $BSS/TSS$ and ranges between zero 
and one, with  one representing the best possible fit. Furthermore, in an ideal scenario clusters have the properties of both internal cohesion and external seperation (Mehar et al., 2013). With this in mind, the goal of the k-means 
algorithm can be denoted as follows, where the goal is to assign each object
to a cluster, so that the above can be achieved (Xu and Wunsch, 2005):
\begin{align}
min \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K \gamma_{ik} {||x_i-\mu_k||^2}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
\gamma_{ik} = \left\{
  \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
    1, & \text{if}\ x_i \in C_k \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{array}\right.
  \text{ .}
\end{align}

Finding a solution for the algorithm is NP-hard, meaning that there is no known polynomial algorithm that can solve the problem, resulting in the computational 
time of said solution to grow exponentially with the size of the problem 
(Dasgupta and Freund, 2009). Additionally, k-means is a greedy algorithm, which 
may result in the solution not being a global optimum (Hartigan and Wong, 1979; Drineas et al., 2004). Despite this, k-means is popular due to its simplicity 
and fast local optimum convergence. 

## Algorithms
A fair amount of algorithms for k-means clustering exist, which heuristically 
attempt to create the "best" clusters. Commonly used ones are the previously 
mentioned algorithms of Lloyd (1982) and MacQueen (1967), as well as Hartigan 
and Wong's (1979) method. The main difference between the two latter and Lloyd's
method is the calculation of centers. For both MacQueen as well as Hartigan and 
Wong's algorithm, the centers are updated every time a data point is moved to or
from a cluster. With Lloyd's algorithm the cluster centers are only updated once
all data points have been assigned, which is known as batch mode (Morissette and Chartier, 2013). Furthermore, Lloyd's method only iterates if a cluster has a
point closer to some other cluster's center, while Hartigan and Wong's method
takes the change of all centers resulting from a reassignment into account. This
implies, that a data point may be reassigned despite already being assigned to
the closest center (Telgarsky and Vattani, 2010). Despite a less efficient
clustering process, Lloyd's algorithm provides satisfactory results in most 
cases. Therefore, to implement the k-means algorithm, Lloyd's method will be 
used. Jain (2010) summarizes the procedure of Lloyd's algorithm in four steps:

1. Initialize k-partition randomly or based on prior knowledge.
2. Assign each object in the data set to the nearest cluster.
3. Recalculate the centers.
4. Repeat 2. and 3. until clusters do not change.

# Developement 
In this section the development approach and implementation of **kmeanss3** is discussed.

## Approach
For the implementation of the k-means algorithm a top-down approach was used. Firstly, a pseudo-code was created which is based on the previously mentioned 
four step approach of Jain (2010). In the fourth step, two measures are used to decide whether the clustering process has been completed or not. These are the maximum number of allowed iterations, and convergence, i.e. when the mean 
squared difference between old centers and newly assigned centers is smaller 
than the previously defined stop criterion. The pseudo-code was then used to 
develop the package contents in the R-Studio environment and is displayed below.
```{r pseudoCode, eval=FALSE}
input:  data    x (matrix)
        centers k (number or matrix)
        iter.max
        stop.criterion

for inputs:
        assert numeric
        assert no NA

if k is numeric:
        if length of k < rows in x
          create k centers using sample()
else:
        if k < rows in x
          take input k as centers

iter = 0
converged = F

while iter < max iterations & converged = F & stop criterion < threshold:
  assign object to cluster where distance minimal
  update centers and current threshhold
  do until convergence (stop criterion > treshold)
```

## Implementation
The implementation of **kmeanss3** is based on the background presented in
Chapter 2. The previously mentioned statistical concepts as well as the 
algorithm were implemented in the programming language R and compiled as part of 
the package **kmeanss3**. For this, the S3-System, which is an object-oriented 
system within R (Wickham, 2015), was used to implement a print, summary, and 
plot method. Additionally, sanity checks were implemented to control both the
input data as well as generated data, e.g. missing values, non-numeric values, 
more centers than data points, etc. Using control structures, in this case if-
functions, the package offers the possibility of both specifying initial centers
as well as the number of randomly generated centers. Additionally, it is 
possible to define the maximum number of iterations as well as the stop 
criterion. To assign points to the initial clusters as well as update the 
centers, a while-loop was implemented. The loop checks whether the criteria 
mentioned in 3.1 have been reached and furthermore uses the 
*clusterAssignment()* function to assign points to the nearest cluster based on
the squared Euclidean distance. Lastly, using for-loops the metrics WSS and 
TSS are calculated. The BSS is derived from subtracting the WSS from TSS, for
which the statistical background is mentioned in 2.2. 

In this chapter, the undertaken approach as well as implementation process
were demonstrated. By using the literature-review based foundations a pseudo-
code for the k-means algorithm was created. The pseudo-code was presented and
served as a basis to create the fundaments of the R code. The package 
**kmeanss3** uses control structures, functions as well as the S3-System, which 
also allows for visualization of the analysis results.

# kmeanss3
This section explains how to obtain the package **kmeanss3**. Additionally, the
functionalities of the package are presented.

## Obtaining the software
The following will demonstrate how to obtain **kmeanss3**. First, the package
must be downloaded and then installed using the *install.packages()* command.
Additionally, **kmeanss3** requires the packages **scales** (Wickham, 2018). It 
can then be loaded into the environment using the command *library()* in the 
console or script window. 
```{r obtainPackage}
# install necessary package kmeanss3
install.packages("~/Desktop/Uni/Master/R-Seminar/kmeanss3/kmeanss3_1.0.tgz", 
                 repos = NULL, type = .Platform$pkgType)

# load the package
library("kmeanss3")
```
## Functionality
The **kmeanss3** package is used to cluster numeric data. The clustering method
is k-means and Llodyd's algorithm is used to assign objects to clusters. The
main function can be called using **myMeans()**, which also offers a help page.
To demonstrate available compomenents, it is assumed that the results are saved
under *results* (by using *results* <- *myMeans()*).

1. *myMeans()* - main function with inputs *x*, *k*, and optionally 
*maxIteration* and *stopCrit*.
2. *results$clusters* - returns a cluster vector which shows the assignment of 
data point i to cluster k.
3. *results$centers* - returns the centers (means) for each cluster k.
4. *results$totss* - returns the total sum of squares.
5. *results$withinss* - returns the within-cluster sum of squares for each 
cluster k.
6. *results$tot.withinss* - returns the sum of within-cluster sum of squares.
7. *results$betweenss* - returns the between cluster sum of squares.
8. *results$size* - returns the size of each cluster k.
9. *results$iter* - returns the number of iterations before convergence was 
reached.
10. *results$data* - returns the unclustered data input *x*.
11. *plot(results)* - returns an x-y plot in which data points are colored by
cluster assignment and centers are highlighted. If input data has more than two
dimensions, one can select which columns of the data are to be graphed.
12. *print(results)* - prints the key components of the cluster analysis.
13. *summary(results*) - returns a standard summary of input object.

# Example: IRIS dataset
In this section the functionalities of **kmeanss3** will be demonstrated using
the **IRIS** dataset. The results will be compared with the **CRAN** *kmeans()*.

## Loading and description of data
For the example analysis the **IRIS** dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning
Repository** (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is used. The dataset
is commonly used for pattern recognition and is well suited for cluster 
analysis. After obtaining the dataset it is loaded into the environment.
```{r loadIris}
# loading the data
irisData <- read.csv("/Users/friedrichvogt/Desktop/Uni/Master/R-Seminar/iris.csv")
```

The structure of the dataset is as follows:
```{r exploreIris}
# data structure
str(irisData)
summary(irisData)
```

The dataset contains 150 observations (n = 150) in three classes that represent different types of iris plants. For each of the classes (Iris-setosa, Iris-veriscolour, and Iris-virginica) 50 observations are recorded. The sepals 
and petals of the plants are each documented by width and length length in cm. 
As k-means clusters numeric values, the class will be excluded from analysis. 
Furthermore, to ensure two dimensions only the sepals will be clustered based
on their documented width and length. The mean value for *sepal.length* is 
5.84, and for *sepal.width* 3.05. With medians of 5.8 and and 3.0 for the 
latter.

## K-means clustering and analysis of data
As previously mentioned, the first two columns of the **IRIS** dataset are 
analyzed. The analysis results are compared with the **CRAN** kmeans. *kmeans()* offers four algorithms, which have been previously discussed. As **kmeanss3** 
uses Lloyd's algorithm, this must also be specified in *kmeans()* function as an
argument. Lastly, the results of **kmeanss3** are plotted with the built-in S3-method. To ensure that all results are reproducible *set.seed(2019)* is used. 

```{r clusterAnalysisMyMeans}
# using kmeanss3
set.seed(2019)
useMyMeans <- myMeans(irisData[1:2], 4)
useMyMeans
```

A total of four clusters with sizes 43, 25, 31, and 51 have been created. The
initial selection of clusters was randomized. The output presents the cluster
means, a cluster vector, the WSS as well as goodness of fit. Output values will
not be rounded, to ensure fair comparison with the output of *kmeans()*. 


The results of the analysis show that the created clusters are good, with 78.5% goodness of fit. The cluster means for *sepal.length* are 6.85, 4.77, 5.19, and 
5.90, while the cluster means for *sepal.width* are 3.10, 2.90, 3.63, and 2.73. Considering the mean values of 5.84 for *sepal.length* and 3.0 for 
*sepal.width*, the clusters are close to the means. This is also underlined by
the WSS values of 11.42, 4.51, 4.54 and 7.48 in order of clusters. Despite this,
one can see a dispersion in the values of WSS, especially when comparing the
first and last cluster with the second and third. This is due to the cluster
means for the first cluster being further apart (6.85 and 3.10) than e.g. the
cluster means of the second cluster (4.77 and 2.90). 

Thus, clusters two and three show less dispersion than clusters one and four
and could therefore be considered "better", as the goal of k-means is to 
minimize the distance. 

The results of *kmeans()* are presented below.
```{r clusterAnalysisCRAN}
# using base kmeans
set.seed(2019)
kMeansCRAN <- kmeans(irisData[1:2], 4, algorithm = "Lloyd")
kMeansCRAN
```
The results align with the results of **kmeanss3**, specifically the *myMeans()*
function. 

```{r myMeansPlot}
# plotting the results
plot(useMyMeans)
```
The results of the k-means cluster analysis using **kmeanss3** can be plotted
as seen above. The plot visualizes the results, which show that four distinct
clusters have been generated. The cluster means are highlighted by enlarged 
points. From the plot one can see, that the colored data points are scattered
closely around their cluster's center. The previously presented analysis results 
are further underlined. While a larger dispersion of data points around cluster
one can be seen, the points assigned to other clusters are less scatted around
the centers of their respective clusters.

This section of the paper presented how to obtain the package as well as the
functionalities of **kmeanss3**. The package was used to group the two variables
*sepal.length* and *sepal.width* of the **IRIS** dataset into four clusters. The
results were discussed and then compared with the **CRAN** *kmeans()* to show equality. These were then visualized using the built-in plot method of 
**kmeanss3**.

# Discussion
In this paper the developement as well as functionalities of the R-package **kmeanss3** were presented. Based on statistical and theoretical foundations
derived from an extensive literature-review, the implementation was described. 
The package can be used to perform k-means clustering based on Lloyd's (1982)
algorithm. It is possible to visualize the results using *plot()*. The package 
uses functions, control structres, and S3-system methods. The functionality of 
the package was presented using a free publicly-available dataset. The presented 
results aligned with the benchmark set by the **CRAN** *kmeans()* algorithm. 

In future development the package could be extended to provide further 
functionalities. Firstly, more clustering algorithms could be added to offer
more variability regarding the clustering process, as is done in *kmeans()*. 
Second, a random initialization of centers is done when *k* is a number. A
commonly used method is to do *n* random initializations and select the centers
with the smallest within-cluster sum of squares. *kmeans()* offers the argument *n.iter*, which can be used to provide better results based on *n* iterations of
the initial centers. For future changes, this could be implemented in 
**kmeanss3** to provide better clusters.
